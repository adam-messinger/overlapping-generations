# James K. Galbraith & Jing Chen: Entropy Economics and Jevons Paradox

## Core Concept: Entropy Economics
Galbraith and Chen argue that the economy is a **physical system** governed by the laws of thermodynamics, specifically the flow of energy and the generation of entropy (disorder/waste).
*   **Value** is not just subjective utility but is rooted in the **availability of low-entropy energy** (useful work) relative to the cost of extraction.
*   **Production** is the process of taking low-entropy resources (like oil or sunlight) and transforming them into structured goods (capital/consumption), while dissipating high-entropy waste (heat/pollution).

## Jevons Paradox in their Framework
Their model provides a biophysical explanation for Jevons Paradox (where efficiency gains lead to *more* consumption, not less).

### 1. The Mechanism: Cost Reduction = Expansion
When a new technology improves energy efficiency (e.g., a better steam engine or cheaper solar panel):
*   The **effective cost** of energy services drops.
*   This releases resources (capital and labor) that were previously tied up in paying for energy.
*   In a competitive system, these released resources are not "saved" (left idle). They are immediately reinvested to **expand production** or **develop new activities** that were previously too expensive.

### 2. The Historical Record
Galbraith notes that energy transitions are typically **additive**, not substitutive:
*   **Coal vs. Oil:** When oil replaced coal for transport, coal use didn't vanish; it migrated to electricity generation, where it grew massively.
*   **Rail vs. Air:** Airplanes didn't just replace trains; they enabled a vastly larger volume of high-speed travel that was physically impossible with trains.

### 3. Implications for the Energy Transition
Applying this to the Green Transition (Solar/Wind):
*   **Standard View:** Renewables will *replace* fossil fuels, and total energy demand will stabilize or fall due to efficiency (electrification).
*   **Galbraith/Chen View:** If renewables become extremely cheap (low entropy cost), the economy will likely expand to consume that surplus.
    *   Fossil fuels might not simply disappear if they remain cheap and useful for specific niches (or if the "released" demand drives up prices for everything else).
    *   **Total Energy Use** is likely to rise, as the "Entropy Budget" of the civilization expands.

## Relation to Growth Theory
Their work challenges Solow-Swan models (like the simulation in this project) which treat "Technology" (TFP) as "Manna from Heaven."
*   **In Solow:** Better tech means you get more output for the same input. You can choose to work less or consume the same with less energy.
*   **In Entropy Economics:** Better tech (lower entropy cost) *compels* the system to grow. A system that voluntarily restricts its growth while high-quality energy is available is evolutionarily disadvantaged against one that doesn't (echoing Odum's Maximum Power Principle).

## Key Takeaway for Modeling
A model that predicts **declining total energy use** alongside **falling energy costs** (cheap solar) is fundamentally at odds with the thermodynamic history of economic growth. Unless there is an explicit **constraint** (policy cap or physical limit), cheaper energy invariably leads to higher consumption.
