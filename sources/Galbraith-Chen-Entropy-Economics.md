## Core Concept: Value as Entropy Reduction
Chen (2002) identifies economic value mathematically as **entropy reduction**, following Shannon's identification of information as negative entropy:

*   **V(P) = -log_b P** — Value is a function of scarcity (probability P). When P=1 (abundant), value=0. When P→0 (scarce), value→∞. This resolves the diamond-water paradox.
*   **V(X) = -Σ p_i log p_i** — The general form is Shannon entropy. Value, like information, measures reduction of disorder.
*   The base *b* represents the number of producers/choices. More producers → lower unit value (competition reduces value). Monopoly (b→1) → infinite value.
*   **Substitutability reduces value:** Joint entropy V(X,Y) ≤ V(X) + V(Y). Equality only when goods are independent. Brand management aims to reduce substitutability.
*   **Division of labor increases value:** Total economic value V = M log n (M = population, n = professions). Finer specialization → more total value.

### Physical Grounding
Both natural selection (struggle to stay alive = maintain low entropy) and sexual selection (display of low entropy signals attractiveness) link economic value to physical entropy. Low entropy sources that are irrelevant to human life have no economic value — value requires "resonance" between sender and receiver (equivocation, from information theory: R = H(x) - H_y(x)).

### Key Implications from Chen (2002)
*   **Information asymmetry is universal**, not a "market imperfection" — unless people are identical, equivocation > 0 always.
*   **Firms exist** because shared context reduces equivocation, lowering transaction costs (Coase explained via entropy).
*   **New ideas have low initial value** — if x is independent of established paradigm y, then H_y(x) = H(x) and received value R = 0.
*   **Economic wealth ≠ social welfare** — wealth is maintained low entropy, ultimately supported by natural low entropy (fossil fuels = stored biological low entropy).

## Biophysical Production Theory (Chen & Galbraith)
The economy is a **thermodynamic system**: organisms/organizations must extract low entropy from the environment to compensate for continuous dissipation. Two fundamental properties of life:
1.  Living systems must extract resources to compensate for continuous diffusion (Schrodinger)
2.  Total cost of extraction must be less than resources extracted (natural selection as economic principle)

**Production** is the process of taking low-entropy resources and transforming them into structured goods, while dissipating high-entropy waste.

## Jevons Paradox: A Biophysical Explanation
The Chen & Galbraith production theory provides a rigorous explanation for Jevons Paradox:

### The Mechanism: Fixed Cost / Variable Cost Tradeoff
Technology improvement = **lower variable cost at the expense of higher fixed cost**. Since higher fixed-cost systems require larger output volumes to break even, total resource use must increase:

> "It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economic use of fuel is equivalent to the diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth." — Jevons (1865)

*   Hybrid cars: two engines = higher manufacturing cost (fixed). Only break even on resources if driven extensively. The technology *guarantees* high consumption.
*   Energy transitions are **additive**, not substitutive: coal didn't vanish when oil arrived; it migrated to electricity generation.

### Implications for the Energy Transition
*   **Standard View:** Renewables replace fossil fuels; total energy demand stabilizes or falls due to efficiency.
*   **Biophysical View:** If renewables become extremely cheap (low variable cost), the economy will expand to consume the surplus. Total energy use rises as the "entropy budget" of civilization expands.
*   A model predicting **declining total energy use** alongside **falling energy costs** is at odds with thermodynamic history — unless there is an explicit **constraint** (policy cap or physical limit).

## Relation to Growth Theory
Their work challenges Solow-Swan models which treat "Technology" (TFP) as exogenous:
*   **In Solow:** Better tech → more output for same input. You can choose to work less.
*   **In Entropy Economics:** Better tech (lower entropy cost) *compels* the system to grow. A system that voluntarily restricts growth while high-quality energy is available is evolutionarily disadvantaged (echoing Odum's Maximum Power Principle).
*   The Cobb-Douglas production function "has little relevance to real economic activities" — a meta-analysis "emphatically rejects the Cobb-Douglas specification" (Gechert et al, 2021, cited in Chen & Galbraith).

## Key Takeaway for Modeling
The simulation's Ayres-Warr biophysical production model (GDP driven by useful energy with γ=0.55) is well-aligned with Chen & Galbraith's framework. The key warning: unless policy constraints or physical limits are modeled, cheaper energy should lead to higher total consumption, not lower.
